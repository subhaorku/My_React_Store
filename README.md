# REACT_STORE
I have built my REACT_STORE which has Add to Cart and Add Product features embedded in it.
If we click on 'Add to Cart' button then the product will get added to my Cart and in Cart we can increase/decrease the Quantity of any added product in Cart.There is a checkout button as well which will basically close the Cart Module. 
We can even add our products in the 'REACT_STORE' by entering the product name and click on the button 'Add Product'.
