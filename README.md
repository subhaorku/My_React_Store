# The_React_Store
I have built an e-commerce app named 'My REACT STORE' which has Add to Cart and Add Product features embedded in it.
If we click on 'Add to Cart' button then the product will get added to my Cart and in Cart we will have info about the product added to cart (which includes image of the product and name of the product),we can increase/decrease the Quantity of any added product in Cart.There is a checkout button as well which will basically close the Cart Module. 
We can even add our products in the 'REACT_STORE' by entering the product name and click on the button 'Add Product'.
If we click on 'Add to Cart' button then the product will get added to my Cart and in Cart we will have info about the product added to cart (which includes image of the product and name of the product),we can increase/decrease the Quantity of any added product in Cart and when Quantity value decreases to 0 by clicking on minus Quantity button then that item gets deleted from the Cart.Eventually, when all items get deleted from the Cart then an empty-Cart Modal shows up with a Close Button.There is a CheckOut button as well which shows up when there is atleast one item in the Cart and CheckOut Button  will basically close the Cart Module. 
We can even add our products in the 'REACT_STORE' by clicking on the button 'Add Product' and then we have to enter the product name. Our Custom product can also be added to the Cart and has the features as other products.
I have deployed the REACT_APP which is accessible via this link: https://the-react-store-subhaorkus-projects.vercel.app , the-react-store-git-main-subhaorkus-projects.vercel.app , the-react-store-52rsoo9an-subhaorkus-projects.vercel.app .
